    <p>Deep breathing exercises can help calm your nervous system. Try taking slow, deep breaths when you're feeling stressed.</p>

    <h2>3. Exercise Regularly</h2>

    <h2>5. Practice Mindfulness</h2>

    <h2>7. Seek Social Support</h2>
    <p>Talk to friends or family members about your stress. Sharing your feelings with someone you trust can provide emotional support.</p>

    <h2>8. Limit Stimulants</h2>
    <p>Reduce the consumption of stimulants like caffeine and nicotine, as they can increase feelings of stress and anxiety.</p>

    <h2>9. Set Realistic Goals</h2>
    <p>Avoid setting unrealistic expectations for yourself. Set achievable goals to reduce unnecessary stress.</p>

    <h2>10. Consider Professional Help</h2>
